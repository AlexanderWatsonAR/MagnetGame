The player controls a spinning electromagnet which catches falling objects.

Catching an object increases the players score, depending on the value of the item caught.

The electromagnet power supply is limited though. Once the power supply reaches 0% the game is over.

The player can extend the power supply by catching batteries.

The game has a global leaderboard. The highest scores top the leaderboard.
